\section{Introduction}

Why this is a good idea. -- research and innovation is being held back by concerns over privacy, confidentiality, credit, isolation between goals

Why this is the right time. -- explosion of data, benefit of data analysis,  need for collaboration

Why we are the right folks. -- build MOC, Dataverse, and practical MPC

The chances of success. -- very high.  Already have many users of DataVerse and MOC.  

\subsection{Motivation}

case of average salaries without reveal each parties data and no one wants responsibility.

NIH requirement to make funded data pubic after time limit.   Before time limit, collaboration is still possible

Better to be safe than sorry.  Once data is ``out of the box'' cannot put it back in.
